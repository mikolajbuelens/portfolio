        Technology has fascinated me for as long as I can remember. Whether it
        was video games or the internet, I was always curious about how things
        worked. Problem-solving has always been a passion of mine, and I thrive
        on learning new things and continuously improving. Currently, I’m
        studying Multimedia & Creative Technology at Erasmus Hogeschool Brussel
        in Anderlecht, Belgium, where my journey into web development truly
        began. From mastering HTML to diving deep into PHP and Laravel, I've
        gained valuable knowledge each year, along with a growing admiration for
        back-end development. Now, as I near the end of my academic journey, I’m
        excited to seek an internship to further hone my skills.
